This mod adds chemical genes for Ambrosia. If there is a mod that adds drugs, but doesn't add drug genes, let me know in the comments or on the discord, and I'll try to add them.

Due to the nature of Luciferium, it can't be added to this mod. The addiction requires more consumption than the dependency gene and is more punishing, and the resistance gene wouldn't work.

[url=https://discord.gg/fYP8qkcNDh]Discord link[/url] for those who want an easier way to ask questions, make requests, or just chat. I'll also be posting new releases there.
